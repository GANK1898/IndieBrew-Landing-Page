# IndieBrew-Landing-Page
There is one website which gives challenges of creating a webpages, it consists of different level challenges i.e,.Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced. These challenges help one to apply the theory you learnt into practical knowledge.
This IndieBrew landing page is one of the beginner challenges from that website. I've created a landing page with the help of HTML and CSS and also added a simple media query to make it responsive. I've used Bootstrap to create the footer of the webpage.
